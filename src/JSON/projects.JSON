    "description":"'The Pizza Restauraunt' is a website developed by me where the intended client is a restauraunt that will use this website for taking delivery orders and acting as a way for customers to view about the business and its menu. The website makes use of the features of the Vue Framework by using 'V-IF' and 'V-FOR' statements in order to fetch menu data from where it is stored in a JSON File. The added power that the Vue Framework provides also allowed me to add the option for the user to filter the menu by type, which can be expanded later on by adding more buttons for more filter criteria. A JSON File is also used to store discount codes which will be used to check if a user-entered discount code is correct or not, and if it is correct to get the amount (in currency or a percentage of the total) that the discount is worth.",
